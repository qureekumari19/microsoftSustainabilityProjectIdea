Scability :
  This digital Solution needs to b scalable to handle increasing volume of data and user.To achieve this , we can use Azure's Auto Scaling Capabilities, which will automatically add or remove computing resources based on the demand for the application.We can also use Azure's database service as Azure Cosmos DBwhich provide globally distributed Scalable NOSQL database for sorting and managing large set of data.
